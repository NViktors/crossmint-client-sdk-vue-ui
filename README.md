# Crossmint.io Client SDK for Vue.js

The Crossmint SDK allows you to offer wallet-less credit card purchases on your NFT drop. It takes 5 lines of code and 5 min to integrate, and is free to use for the seller. Youâ€™ll get the sales proceeds in SOL/ETH as if the user was paying with their own wallet.

Supported chains:

- Solana
- Polygon (for docs: contact us at sales at crossmint.io)
- Ethereum L1 (end of March 2021)

To get started:
